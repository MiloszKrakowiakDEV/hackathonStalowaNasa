We are a team of six dedicated students from Zespół Szkół im. Stanisławaw in Tarnobrzeg, participating in the NASA Space Apps Challenge Stalowa Wola 2024. Our mission is to contribute to global education by creating interactive and engaging materials centered around the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Our website offers lessons on each of the 17 SDGs, as well as quizzes to deepen understanding. We also believe in learning through fun, which is why we've created an educational board game that teaches key SDG concepts in an engaging way.

Join us in educating and inspiring others to take action for a better world!
