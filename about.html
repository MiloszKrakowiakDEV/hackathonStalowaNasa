        SDGs EDU is an innovative educational platform designed for students worldwide, combining 
        lessons on various school subjects with information about the United Nations Sustainable 
        Development Goals (SDGs). Our mission is to provide modern educational tools that help students
         understand the global challenges of our time, such as climate change, poverty eradication, 
         and inclusive education for all.<br>

        The platform offers interactive lessons, knowledge-checking quizzes, and a unique educational 
        board game that introduces students to the concepts of the SDGs in a fun and engaging way. Our 
        materials are designed to support teaching in schools across the globe.<br>
        
        SDGs EDU is the result of the hard work of a team of six students from Zespół Szkół im. ks. Stanisława Staszica in Tarnobrzeg, 
        who took on the challenge of creating this platform during the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. 
        We believe that our project will become a valuable resource for teachers and students, 
        raising awareness of sustainable development and contributing to building a better future.
