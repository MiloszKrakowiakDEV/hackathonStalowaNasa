            <h1>Biodiversity and Healthy Marine Ecosystems</h1>
            <p>Marine ecosystems are the lifeblood of our planet, providing essential services that support human life and the health of the global environment. SDG 14, “Life Below Water,” emphasizes the need to protect and sustainably manage the world’s oceans, seas, and marine resources. Oceans host a vast diversity of species, regulate the Earth’s climate, and provide food and livelihoods for billions of people.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Facing Marine Biodiversity</h2>
            <img src="../img/fish2.png" alt="Weather Patterns" style="width:10%; margin-top:5px; margin-left: 5px; border-radius:8px; float:right;">
            <p>Human activities are placing immense pressure on marine ecosystems. Key challenges include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overfishing:</strong> Unsustainable fishing practices deplete fish populations and disrupt marine food webs.</li>
                <li><strong>Pollution:</strong> Plastic waste, oil spills, and chemical runoff from agriculture and industry pollute marine environments, harming marine life and reducing water quality.</li>
                <li><strong>Climate Change:</strong> Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification threaten coral reefs, fish populations, and the overall health of marine ecosystems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Impact on Global Populations and Food Security</h2>
            <img src="../img/fish3.png" alt="Extreme Weather Events" style="width:17%; margin-top:5px; border-radius:8px; float:right;">
            <p>Marine biodiversity loss has far-reaching impacts on communities around the world. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Food insecurity:</strong> With over 3 billion people relying on seafood as a primary source of protein, declining fish stocks can lead to malnutrition and food shortages.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic instability:</strong> The degradation of marine ecosystems negatively impacts industries like fishing and tourism, threatening the livelihoods of coastal communities.</li>
                <li><strong>Increased vulnerability:</strong> Coastal areas become more vulnerable to extreme weather events and sea-level rise as ecosystems like coral reefs and mangroves degrade.</li>

            <h2>Community and Global Engagement Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Collaborate with your school or community to develop a project that promotes marine conservation, such as building awareness about sustainable fishing or reducing plastic use.</li>
                <li>2. For one month, commit to buying locally-grown, organic produce. Track how this choice impacts your awareness of sustainable farming practices and the local agricultural economy.</li>
                <li>3. Participate in a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program or buy from local farmers markets. Learn about the farming practices of small-scale farmers and reflect on how they contribute to sustainable soil management.</li>
                <li>4. Develop a personal or family plan to reduce food waste and support sustainable agriculture. This could include meal planning, composting, or reducing your consumption of processed and non-local foods.</li>
                <li>5. If you garden, challenge yourself to avoid synthetic fertilizers for one growing season. Instead, use compost, manure, or other organic alternatives, and observe how it affects plant growth and soil quality.</li>
            </ul>
